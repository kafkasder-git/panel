Here we will see that a folder is just another collection with the same bells and whistles. We will also make a request which uses the parent collection's "Authorization" config.

Open the "Send token" request and click the "Send" button. You should see the response as well as a passing test that says "Successfuly sent bearer token!"

Don't worry about the test and the script for now, we will cover it in details later.
