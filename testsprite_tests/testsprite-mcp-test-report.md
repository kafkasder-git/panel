## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Conclusion

The Kafkasder Management Panel requires **significant development work** before
it can be considered production-ready. While the basic authentication and mobile
responsiveness work well, critical security vulnerabilities, navigation issues,
and missing features pose serious risks to the application's functionality and
security.

**Recommendation**: Do not deploy to production until all critical issues are
resolved and comprehensive testing is completed.
