#### Test TC003
- **Test Name:** Auto-Generation of Membership Numbers
- **Test Code:** [TC003_Auto_Generation_of_Membership_Numbers.py](./TC003_Auto_Generation_of_Membership_Numbers.py)

- **Test Code:** [TC009_Legal_Documents_Page_Fixes_and_Upload_Functionality.py](./TC009_Legal_Documents_Page_Fixes_and_Upload_Functionality.py)
- **Test Error:** The critical bug fixes for the Legal Documents page were partially verified. Navigation to the page and UI elements functioned correctly. The document upload form opened and accepted input for all fields except the file upload, which could not be automated due to file input element limitations. Attempts to submit without a file were blocked by validation as expected. No UI glitches or errors were observed during the process. The file upload step remains unverified due to environment constraints. Task is not fully complete.
